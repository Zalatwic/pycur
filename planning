	to send use S####.#
	use the prefix TX to attach your miner fee to it

how nodes work
	transactions
		recieves transactions from wallets
			packet recieved with structure {"!", [TX], [RECIEVING @], [SENDING @], [SIG]} 
		gives transactions to miners
			based off highest miners fee * amount of time waiting
			packet structure as such {"N", [TX], [RECIEVING @], [SENDING @], [SIG], [REWARD], [EPOCH RECIEVED], [TIMES BROADCAST]}
		trades transactions with other nodes
			keeps track of how many times its been broadcast
		deletes transactions as mined
